We propose a branch and bound algorithm for the Glass Cutting problem presented by Saint-Gobain at the EURO/ROADEF 2018 challenge.
This approach leads to promising results and seems competitive with the other approaches used during the challenge.

It consists of a decision model which enumerates all solutions as trees, node selection criteria and a branching strategy that explores the possible solutions starting by hopefully the best ones.
Several trees are explored in parallel with different heuristics. Each time a better solution is found, it benefits all tree explorations. We run in parallel four restarting branch and bounds with different parameters.
At the beginning, the algorithm behaves like a greedy random and at the end like a branch and bound. This principle allows to find good solutions first and guarantee to improve with more execution time. Using this principle, we can achieve a good performance for both short and long time runs.

If the instance has a small number of stacks, we can run a dynamic programming inspired approach using an A* algorithm that is guaranteed to provide an optimal solution quickly. This approach is able to return good solutions for instances A17 and B5 in less than a few seconds.

In this talk, we will describe more in details the algorithm, including the general architecture but also the specific cuts allowing us to break symmetries and how to remove dominated partial solutions.
